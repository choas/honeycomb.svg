# honeycomb.svg

This code was mostely generated with Claude 3.7 and this prompt:

```text
Create a Python program which generates an SVG file with a honeycomb field where each shifted row fits exactly between the other rows; make the program flexible and use following parameters:
columns=10 # columns per row
rows=8 # contains odd and even rows
length=50 # in mm - the length for all six honeycomb sides (each side has the same length)
angle=120 # in degrees - the angle between the top and bottom tips of the honeycomb
distance=2 # in mm - the distance between each comb in a row and the distance to the honeycombs in the next shifted row

honeycomb structure with a top and bottom tip:
/\
| |
\/

Based on these parameters the program calculates for each honeycomb the position, therefore, itâ€™s important that the distance to the next honeycomb is the same and there is no overlapping. Write the program in a way that it will test  this constraint and adjust it self (log each adjustment).
```
